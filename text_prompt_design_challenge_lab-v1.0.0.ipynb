    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge lab is designed to test your knowledge of calling Gemini and utilizing a few fundamental text prompt design techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two featured guides on prompting from the Google Cloud documentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Overview of prompting strategies](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies) from the Generative AI on Vertex AI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Prompt design strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies) from the Gemini API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain good tips. You are encouraged to **bookmark them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize Vertex AI in your environment\n",
    "- Load a generative model\n",
    "- Guide model output with a persona\n",
    "- Extract information to a schema\n",
    "- Stay on topic with fallback responses\n",
    "- Use examples to influence the model's response\n",
    "\n",

      "Whether you're a seasoned gym-goer or just starting your fitness journey, there are plenty of effective leg exercises to choose from. Here are some options, categorized by difficulty level:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Beginner:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Bodyweight Squats:** This classic exercise targets your quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward. Lower your body as if sitting in a chair, keeping your back straight and core engaged. Return to the starting position.\n",
      "* **Lunges:** Lunges work your quads, glutes, hamstrings, and calves. Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until both knees are bent at 90-degree angles. Keep your front knee aligned with your ankle and your back knee hovering just above the ground. Push off your front foot to return to the starting position. \n",
      "* **Calf Raises:** Stand on your toes with your heels lifted off the ground. Hold for a second before lowering back down. You can perform this exercise with your feet flat on the ground, on a slight incline, or even on a step for added difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Intermediate:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Weighted Squats:** Add weight to your bodyweight squats using dumbbells, a barbell, or a kettlebell. This increases the intensity and challenges your muscles further.\n",
      "* **Bulgarian Split Squats:** This single-leg variation of the lunge requires more balance and stability. Place one foot elevated on a bench or step behind you. Lower your body until your front knee is bent at a 90-degree angle and your back knee hovers just above the ground. Push off your front foot to return to the starting position.\n",
      "* **Pistol Squats:** This advanced exercise requires significant strength and balance. Stand on one leg and lower your body as if performing a single-leg squat. Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the movement. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Advanced:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Barbell Deadlifts:** Deadlifts are a full-body exercise that heavily engages your legs, back, and core. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart in front of a barbell. Hinge at your hips and bend your knees slightly to grasp the bar with an overhand grip. Keeping your back straight and core engaged, lift the bar off the ground by extending your hips and knees. Lower the bar back to the ground with control. \n",
      "* **Jump Squats:** This explosive exercise combines squats with plyometrics. Perform a regular squat, but instead of standing up, jump explosively and extend your arms overhead. Land softly and immediately transition into another squat.\n",
      "* **Box Jumps:** Stand in front of a sturdy box that is slightly below knee height. Squat down and explosively jump onto the box, landing softly with both feet. Step or jump back down to the starting position.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Remember:** \n",
      "\n",
      "* Always start with a proper warm-up to prepare your body for exercise.\n",
      "* Choose weights that are challenging but allow you to maintain good form throughout the movement.\n",
      "* Listen to your body and take rest days when needed.\n",
      "* Consider consulting a personal trainer if you're unsure about proper form or exercise selection.\n",
