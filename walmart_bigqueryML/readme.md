The goal is to transfer the dataset to BigQuery and utilize BigQueryML to demonstrate how easy it is to create prediction models using SQL.

# ingestion
The source data is from Kaggle, specifically Walmart sales. You can either download it directly from Kaggle or access it through this repository. I uploaded the data to Cloud Storage and then utilized Dataflow with a template to load the CSV files into BigQuery
